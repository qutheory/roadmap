# Vapor Cloud - Roadmap

This is the official Vapor Cloud roadmap. Here it's possible to follow the priorities in Vapor Cloud.

It's also possible to suggest tasks.

Versions are created as [Milestones](https://github.com/vapor-cloud/roadmap/milestones)

## Add entry

If you want to add an entry, create an [Issue](https://github.com/vapor-cloud/roadmap/issues) and add as much information as possible.

Add a `kind/*` and a `version/*` label fitting to the entry (and `area/*` if possible).
